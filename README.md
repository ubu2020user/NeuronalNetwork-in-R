# NeuronalNetwork-in-R
This project was an attempt of a **proof of concept** to create a NeuronalNetwork from scratch.

# General Notice #
This achievement was completed as part of the course for an examination module.
The question was if it is possible to create an object oriented neuronal network in R.
Most of the parts of this neuronal network work. 

The neuronal network example does not work right. 
It has some flaws, that could not be identified and fixed.

# Introduction #
In **Main.R** file you find an example how to use the objects and classes.
It depends on **NeuronalNet.R**. This class contains an example neuronal network out of
the implemented work. The batch is applied after every learn!

For your needs you can create your own "Network" class with different layers, 
momentum changes, batch changes, etc.

The NN example was for testing purposes and as proof of concept.

If you want to use neuronal networks for real tasks, I encourage you to *use libraries* that
are tested, developed and maintained regularly. Those are performant and overall bettter.

If you want to improve, enhance or fix this work. 
Feel free :)

The print function(s) of the NN was the coolest part of the whole work! 
I love it! <3
